# codewars-solutions
I have been doing Codewars daily challenges since August 2025 in preparation for a software engineering apprenticeship.

I actually never realized I'd have so many solutions listed, so the formatting is really ugly. I want to go back and make every problem a separate js file like I did in my leetcode repo.
